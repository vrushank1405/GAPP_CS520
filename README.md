# CS520 - GAPP (Graduate Program Application)

So in this project I had developed a web-based system call Graduate Program Applications, or GAPP, which will host all the application materials.

 - Students will use CSUMentor to submit a university application and use GAPP to submit a department application - we assume that a        department application will be required by all departments.
 - University admission staff will upload scanned transcripts to GAPP.
 - Department staff will upload additional application materials (e.g. personal statement, recommendation letters) to GAPP.
 - Department admission committee will use GAPP to review the applications.
